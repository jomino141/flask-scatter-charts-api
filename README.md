# Scatter ApexCharts API
An API to generate JSON's for 2D and 3D Scatter ApexCharts. 

## Usage
This API requires an array including multiple elements that follow this structure:
```
[[value1, value2, value3, value4, value5],[value6, value7, value8]]
```
The purpose of the API is to generate a scatter chart based on 2 or 3 out of the first 5 values.

The charts are intended to work within a React App. Although not guaranteed, they should also work with other frameworks.
